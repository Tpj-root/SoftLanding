# SoftLanding
Soft Landing is a terminal command that mimics the behavior of the sl command.



## Why did I create the SoftLanding command?

I want to pray every day for Williams and Wilmore, that they return safely to Earth.

While working, I often mistype "sl," and when I do, the Steam Locomotive animation appears.

I want to change that to "SoftLanding" for Williams and Wilmoreâ€”so I can pray every minute, even while I'm working.

That's why I created this SoftLanding project.
